        <p>
            Kamilia Fortas is an underground artist who genuinely loves music.
        </p>
        <blockquote class="quote">
            "Write your pain down
                            Make it sound like poetry"
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            she always wrote music but never got the courage to actually publish it because she was scared people won‚Äôt listen to it nor enjoy it, maybe that fear came from comparing herself too much to what‚Äôs already out there, or maybe just the fear of being vulnerable because music says everything you can‚Äôt always say out loud.
        </p>
        <p>
           then in 2022 she wrote her first track ‚Äú dangerous game‚Äù and posted it on youtube
though her  music was poorly recorded but she didn‚Äôt give up and made songs one after one
even though her songs never really blew up but she continued doing it, just because she genuinely loves music.

                        <p>
This one came from a place of both frustration and clarity.<br><br>

I was in this phase where I was tired of mixed signals, like <em>either show up or step out</em>.<br><br>

So the title <em>Step It Up</em> hit me first. It sounded like a challenge but also a warning.<br><br>

The chorus is really the heart of the whole thing:<br><br>

<blockquote>
"Step it up or I‚Äôm stepping away<br>
Can‚Äôt keep me guessing boy you know that I don‚Äôt play..‚Äù 
</blockquote><br>

I remember writing that part late at night and it just flowed.<br>
I wasn‚Äôt overthinking it. It felt like something you‚Äôd say to someone when you finally hit your limit. It‚Äôs not about being angry, it‚Äôs about knowing your worth, and I think there‚Äôs a little sass in there too in a good way.<br><br>

Musically, it is a very soft song but I tried to keep some energy in the Post Chorus but not too loud either.<br><br>

This song is really for anyone who‚Äôs done playing guessing games.
</p>

                       <p>
This song is probably one of my favorites I‚Äôve ever written. <em>Sure Thing</em> is about that kind of love that you don‚Äôt hesitate for, the kind you‚Äôd bet on even if it scares you.<br><br>

What makes me proud of this one is that... it doesn‚Äôt have a chorus. Just a flow of new lyrics that keep shifting like the emotions behind them. I wanted it to feel like a train of thought, like I‚Äôm speaking straight from the heart without stopping to polish anything.<br><br>

The beat I used had <em>so much soul</em>. If I could describe it, I would say it‚Äôs like soft bravery.<br><br>

My favorite lines were:<br><br>

<blockquote>
"Call it reckless, call it blind<br>
But I don't love you halfway, never tried<br>
You are not a maybe, you are my sure thing<br>
And if you‚Äôre a mistake, I‚Äôma choose you all over."
</blockquote><br>

If you've ever felt that kind of love, the kind that feels like jumping off a cliff but <em>worth it</em>, this one's for you.

                        <p>
<em>Prima Donna</em> was the first time I really let it all out, It‚Äôs technically a ‚Äúdiss‚Äù song, but it‚Äôs more about <em>me</em> than them, It‚Äôs the track that I feel represents <em>who I am</em> as an artist, confident, and kind<br>
and done being underestimated.<br><br>

This song came from a real place. There was someone who clearly didn‚Äôt like me, not because I did anything wrong, but because I was <em>good</em>. Better, even. And they couldn‚Äôt handle it. So instead of shrinking, I wrote this. Not to explain myself, but to rage them more with jealousy.<br><br>

<blockquote>
  "Is that your heart? ‚ÄôCause I wanna break it<br>
  If you want it, then I‚Äôma take it"
</blockquote><br>

It might sound mean, and honestly, it <em>is</em> a little mean but that‚Äôs the point.<br><br>

It‚Äôs not about being nice. It‚Äôs about claiming space. I wanted it to be dramatic and bold at the same time. Every line is designed to make you feel something.<br><br>

The whole track is like pouring gasoline on their ego and lighting a match. And I loved every second of it.<br><br>

This is always the one I show people first when I say <em>"I'm a singer."</em> Because it‚Äôs not just a song, It‚Äôs me, prima donna.

                        <p>
You ever have someone leave your life, but somehow they‚Äôre still everywhere?<br>
Like they sneak into your thoughts when you least expect it<br>
They become part of how you think, how you feel like a line in a poem you didn‚Äôt even mean to write<br><br>

I kept coming back to this idea that<br>
some things no matter how much you want to let them go just stick.<br><br>

That‚Äôs how <em>Poems I Can‚Äôt Burn</em> came to life.<br>
At first, it was about a feeling, but it turned into something bigger.<br>
It became this strange metaphor I couldn‚Äôt even explain.<br><br>

<em>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre another page that I cannot turn<br>
You‚Äôre another poem that I cannot burn.‚Äù</em><br><br>

This song‚Äôs for anyone who‚Äôs ever tried to move on but kept rereading the same chapter.
